This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to divide an integer by zero. This will result in undefined behavior, often leading to program crashes. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version that checks for division by zero before performing the operation, preventing the error and ensuring program stability. This is a fundamental concept in robust programming and illustrates the importance of input validation and error handling.
